# Single-Cell-Fuzzy-Labels


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The `Single-Cell-Fuzzy-Labels` library introduces an innovative label
transfer methodology for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. Utilizing a
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) strategy, the library facilitates the transfer
of labels from newly queried data to a well-annotated reference dataset.
By harnessing the capabilities of pre-trained Single Cell foundation
models in conjunction with advanced language models like GPT-3.5 or 4,
`Single-Cell-Fuzzy-Labels` streamlines the harmonization of different
label sets. This process not only improves the interpretability of label
transfers but also ensures a more coherent integration of data. The
library further provides essential metrics to assess the efficacy of the
label transfer under this new label schema.

## Install

``` sh
pip install Single_Cell_Fuzzy_Labels
```

## How to use

# To utilize the `Single-Cell-Fuzzy-Labels` library in your single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, follow these steps:

1.  Install the library using pip:

    ``` sh
    pip install Single_Cell_Fuzzy_Labels
    ```

2.  Import the library in your Python environment:

    ``` python
    from Single_Cell_Fuzzy_Labels.core import *
    ```

Optional steps before label transfer:

3.  Download pre-trained embeddings from cellxgene:

    ``` python
    embeddings = download_embeddings(cellxgene_url)
    ```

    Or

    Embed your own dataset using a foundation model such as UCE or
    scGPT:

    ``` python
    dataset_embeddings = embed_dataset(your_dataset, model='UCE')
    ```

4.  Assess embedding quality using Single-cell Integration Benchmarking
    (scIB):

    ``` python
    quality_metrics = assess_embedding_quality(dataset_embeddings)
    ```

5.  Prepare your reference dataset with well-annotated labels.

6.  Use the `transfer_labels` function to transfer labels from the
    reference dataset to your new query data:

    ``` python
    transferred_labels = transfer_labels(query_data, reference_data)
    ```

7.  Evaluate the label transfer quality using the provided metrics:

    ``` python
    evaluate_transfer(transferred_labels)
    ```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the
documentation and the tutorials included in the GitHub repository.

``` python
```
